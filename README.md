Concept
=======
I want to showcase my portfolio a lightweight, interactive, and immersive way. "So many high-level buzzwords, what on earth do you mean?" you ask.
  - **Lightweight**: only one page to feature all different kind of photography work: landscape, portrait, wildlife, wedding, etc.
  - **Interactive**: JS animations, tweening, bootstrapped elements
  - **Immersive**: Full-blown, edge-to-edge images. No tiny thumbnails. Use all the screen real estate as I possibly can

Inspirations
============
  - [Google I/O 2014 page](https://www.google.com/events/io)
  - [Coin](https://onlycoin.com)
